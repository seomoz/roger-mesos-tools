# Shares SSH agent credentials, so within a "docker build", the building container
# can access private Github repos. This script brings up the auxiliary container which
# shares the credentials, then stops it when the command you want to run is done.
#
# Usage: "docker-forward-ssh-agent docker build -t foo .", "docker-forward-ssh-agent docker-compose build",
#        "docker-forward-ssh-agent roger deploy -e stage myproject myconfig.yml", etc.
#
# Note: should be used with extreme care on shared computers! You could be exposing your
# credentials for all on the local system to share.
#
# Also, due to the hard-coding of the container name and ports, only one of this script
# can be running at one time.
#
# Uses seomoz/sshagent-socket (forked from aidanhs/sshagent-socket) to forward
# SSH agent to make it available inside a container running `docker build`
#
# See https://github.com/seomoz/docker-sshagent-socket/ for more info on how to
# configure your Docker file to work with this.
